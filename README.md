# Digital Harvest - Accounting-Based Business Simulator

## Project Objective

Digital Harvest is an interactive, terminal-based business simulation engine built on a foundation of real-world accounting principles. This project was designed to create a "digital twin" of a retail business, allowing a user to make high-level strategic decisions about inventory, pricing, and expenses, while accurately tracking the downstream impact on a double-entry accounting ledger.

The primary goal is to provide a robust backend and data model that can be used for sophisticated business intelligence analysis, answering not just "What did we sell?" but "Was the business profitable, and why?" This project showcases the powerful intersection of software engineering, database design, and financial analysis.

## Core Features

### Simulation Engine

* **Double-Entry Accounting:** Every transaction generates corresponding entries in a financial ledger, accurately tracking assets, revenue, and costs according to standard accounting principles.
* **Perpetual Inventory System:** An inventory ledger tracks the quantity and value of stock in real-time as purchases and sales occur.
* **Dynamic Sales Modeling:** A sophisticated sales model that factors in long-term trends, seasonality, weekly cycles, and price sensitivity to generate realistic demand.
* **Persistent State:** The simulation's state (cash on hand, current date) is persisted in the database, allowing it to be stopped and restarted seamlessly.
### User Interfaces & Analysis
* **Web-Based UI:** An interactive dashboard built with React allows you to manage inventory, set prices, and advance the simulation through a user-friendly interface.
* **Terminal Application:** A classic command-line interface provides an alternative way to manage the business day-by-day.
* **BI-Ready Schema:** The normalized MySQL database is designed for direct connection with business intelligence tools like Power BI, enabling the creation of live, interactive dashboards.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS for styling.
* **Data Analysis:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Key Libraries:** `mysql-connector-python`

## Dashboard & Analysis

The data generated by the simulation is visualized in a multi-page Power BI dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive business overview.

The Inventory dashboard provides a snapshot of current stock levels and a historical view of inventory fluctuations over time.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* A running MySQL server
* A tool like MySQL Workbench

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Ensure your MySQL server is running.
2.  Update the `DB_CONFIG` dictionary in `/src/setup_business.py` and `/src/digital_harvest.py` with your MySQL credentials (user, password, host, port).

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python package using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize the Database
Run the setup script **once** from your terminal. This will create the `digital_harvest` database, build the required tables, and populate the initial product catalog.
```bash
python src/setup_business.py
```

*Note: This script will completely drop and recreate the database each time it is run.*

### 4. Run the Simulation
Start the main application to begin running your business.
```bash
python src/digital_harvest.py
```

## Database Schema

## Database Schema

| Table Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `products` & `categories` | Stores the product catalog, including metadata used by the sales simulation AI. |
| `inventory_ledger` | A perpetual log of all inventory movements. Each entry records the change in quantity, the value of the transaction, and the resulting quantity on hand. |
| `financial_ledger` | A classic double-entry accounting ledger. Every business event creates corresponding debit and credit entries, ensuring the accounting equation remains in balance. |
