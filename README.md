## üéØ About the Project

**Digital Harvest** is an interactive business simulation engine that models a retail business with **real-world accounting accuracy**. Unlike typical business games, this simulator maintains a complete **double-entry accounting system**, tracking every transaction through a financial ledger that follows GAAP principles.

### The Vision

The project creates a "digital twin" of a retail business, allowing users to:
- Make high-level strategic decisions about inventory, pricing, and marketing
- See the immediate financial impact of their choices
- Understand the connection between operations and profitability
- Learn business principles through hands-on experimentation

### Why This Matters

Most business simulations simplify or ignore accounting. Digital Harvest proves that you can have both **engaging gameplay** and **financial accuracy**. The normalized database schema makes it perfect for:
- üìä **Business Intelligence**: Connect Power BI for real-time dashboards
- üìö **Education**: Learn accounting principles through interactive simulation
- üî¨ **Analysis**: Answer complex questions like "Which vendor maximizes ROI?"
- üéÆ **Entertainment**: Experience the satisfaction of building a profitable business

**Explore the Stories:** I've documented interesting scenarios and discoveries from the simulation [here](https://matthew-s-jenkins.github.io/digital-harvest-sim/stories/index.html).

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running Digital Harvest, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **MySQL Server 8.0+** running locally or remotely ([Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/))
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-harvest.git
   cd digital-harvest
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure database connection**

   Edit the `DB_CONFIG` dictionary in the following files with your MySQL credentials:
   - `src/setup.py`
   - `src/engine.py`
   - `src/api.py`

   ```python
   DB_CONFIG = {
       'user': 'your_username',
       'password': 'your_password',
       'host': 'localhost',
       'port': 3306
   }
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will drop and recreate the `digital_harvest` database!

   ```bash
   python src/setup.py
   ```

   You should see output confirming table creation and initial data population.

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Start the API server**
   ```bash
   python src/api.py
   ```
   You should see: `* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`

2. **Open the interface**
   - **Simple**: Double-click `index.html` to open directly in your browser
   - **Server**: For better compatibility, run a local web server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8080
     ```
     Then navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/index.html`

#### Option 2: Terminal Interface

For a classic command-line experience:
```bash
python src/cli.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your business day-by-day.

## üìä Dashboard & Analytics

### Web Interface Features

The web dashboard provides six core sections:

1. **üìà Dashboard** - KPIs, sales trends, and inventory breakdown
2. **üì¶ Inventory** - Stock levels, pricing controls, and product filtering
3. **üöö Suppliers** - Vendor catalog, ordering interface, and relationship tracking
4. **üì¢ Marketing** - Campaign launches and performance monitoring
5. **üßæ Expenses** - Recurring cost tracking and analysis
6. **üè¶ Bank** - Loan offers and financing options

### Power BI Analytics

The simulation generates data ready for advanced analysis. Connect Power BI to the MySQL database for:

#### 1. Executive Summary Dashboard

![Executive Summary](screenshots/ExecutiveSummary10.02.25.jpg)

**Purpose**: High-level financial health and profitability overview

**Key Visualizations**:
- **KPI Cards**: Cash, AP Due, Gross Profit, Net Profit
- **Monthly P&L**: Revenue vs. Expenses with Net Profit trend
- **Expense Breakdown**: Interactive donut chart of cost structure
- **Working Capital Trend**: Cash balance vs. liabilities over time
- **Date Slicer**: Filter the entire report by time period

#### 2. Supply Chain & Operations Dashboard

![Supply Chain Dashboard](screenshots/SupplyChain&Operations10.02.25.jpg)

**Purpose**: Operational insights connecting physical activities to financial impact

**Key Visualizations**:
- **Accounting Validation**: Real-time verification of double-entry integrity (Total Debits - Total Credits = $0.00)
- **Vendor Scorecard**: Performance metrics (lead time, on-time delivery %)
- **Live Stock Levels**: Current quantity and value for each product
- **Assets & Equity Chart**: Visualization of the accounting equation over time
- **Interactive Slicers**: Filter by vendor or product category

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture

The database is designed with **normalization** and **referential integrity** in mind:

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `products` | Product catalog with pricing and demand metadata |
| `product_categories` | Hierarchical categorization (Linear, Tactile, Clicky switches) |
| `vendors` | Supplier information (terms, location, minimums, relationships) |
| `inventory_ledger` | **Perpetual inventory system** - every stock movement with running balances |
| `financial_ledger` | **Double-entry accounting** - debits and credits for all transactions |
| `purchase_orders` | Orders placed to vendors with tracking and status |
| `purchase_order_items` | Line items for each PO |
| `accounts_payable` | Outstanding bills to suppliers |
| `expenses` | Recurring operational costs |
| `loans` | Active financing with repayment schedules |
| `marketing_campaigns` | Active promotions with duration and target |
| `market_events` | Random demand-boosting events |
| `business_state` | Current simulation state (date, cash on hand) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Immutable Ledgers**: Financial and inventory ledgers are append-only for audit trails
- **Running Balances**: Ledgers include calculated running balances for performance
- **Foreign Keys**: Enforce referential integrity between all related entities
- **Decimal Precision**: All monetary values use `DECIMAL(15,2)` for accuracy
- **Date Tracking**: Every transaction includes timestamps for time-series analysis
