# Digital Harvest - Accounting-Based Business Simulator

## Project Objective

Digital Harvest is an interactive, terminal-based business simulation engine built on a foundation of real-world accounting principles. This project was designed to create a "digital twin" of a retail business, allowing a user to make high-level strategic decisions about inventory, pricing, and expenses, while accurately tracking the downstream impact on a double-entry accounting ledger.

The primary goal is to provide a robust backend and data model that can be used for sophisticated business intelligence analysis, answering not just "What did we sell?" but "Was the business profitable, and why?" This project showcases the powerful intersection of software engineering, database design, and financial analysis.

## Core Features

* **Double-Entry Accounting:** Every transaction (sales, purchases, expenses) generates corresponding entries in a financial ledger, accurately tracking assets, revenue, and costs.
* **Perpetual Inventory System:** An inventory ledger tracks the quantity and value of stock in real-time as purchases and sales occur.
* **Persistent State:** The simulation can be stopped and restarted at any time. The application state (cash on hand, current date) is persisted in the database.
* **Interactive Terminal UI:** A clean and intuitive command-line interface allows the user to manage their business day-by-day.
* **BI-Ready Schema:** The normalized MySQL database is designed for direct connection with business intelligence tools like Power BI, enabling the creation of live, interactive dashboards.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Data Analysis:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Key Libraries:** `mysql-connector-python`

## Dashboard & Analysis

The data generated by the simulation is visualized in a multi-page Power BI dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive business overview.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* A running MySQL server
* A tool like MySQL Workbench

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Ensure your MySQL server is running.
2.  Update the `DB_CONFIG` dictionary in `/src/setup_business.py` and `/src/digital_harvest.py` with your MySQL credentials (user, password, host, port).

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python package using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize the Database
Run the setup script **once** from your terminal. This will create the `digital_harvest` database, build the required tables, and populate the initial product catalog.
```bash
python src/setup_business.py
```

*Note: This script will completely drop and recreate the database each time it is run.*

### 4. Run the Simulation
Start the main application to begin running your business.
```bash
python src/digital_harvest.py
```

## Database Schema

### `products` & `categories`
Stores the product catalog, including metadata used by the sales simulation AI.

### `inventory_ledger`
A perpetual log of all inventory movements. Each entry records the change in quantity, the value of the transaction, and the resulting quantity on hand. This provides a full, auditable history of every item.

### `financial_ledger`
A classic double-entry accounting ledger. Every business event (sales, purchases, expenses) creates corresponding debit and credit entries, ensuring that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains in balance.
